# Rain_in_Australia

 Dataset taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package 
 
This project was done as part of the Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp at Xccelerate. The dataset is taken from Kaggle. This dataset contains 142194 daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations.

Different ML models were tried to improve accuracy on training and testing data. Since the data was highly balanced, several balancing techniques were used such as Upsampling, Downsampling, SMOTENN to balance the dataset and then applied ML model.

The model was also tuned further using Hyper Parameter Optimization technique such as GridSearchCV.
